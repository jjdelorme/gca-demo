description = "Git commit message helper that produces a safe, escaped git commit message based on current changes."
prompt = """
Your goal is to create a git commit message based on the user's comment {{args}} current git changes.  You should not execute the commit until the user approves of the message.

Identify the relevant JIRA ticket number. If one is not currently in context, you must ask the user for it before proceeding. 

**Ticket format validation:** The ticket must match the pattern `^[A-Z]+-\\d+$` (e.g., `PROJ-123`). If it does not, ask the user to provide or correct the ticket identifier.

**Format Template:**
`[<TICKET-ID>] <Concise description of the change>`

**Examples:**
* ✓ `[PROJ-123] Update user schema to support multiple addresses`
* ✓ `[PROJ-123] Implement address selection dropdown in profile UI`
* ✗ `feat: add multiple addresses` (WRONG: Do not use prefixes)
* ✗ `fixed the bug where it crashed` (WRONG: Missing ticket number)

**REMEMBER** You must always execute a dry-run FIRST and get the user's approval.  Once commit message has been approved by user, proceed with performing commit.
